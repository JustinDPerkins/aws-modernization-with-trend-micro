This helps you gain new visibility into your AWS environment as well as the capability to generate additional reports based of the checks and scans ran by the Conformity Bot. To view these checks, select <b>Browse all Checks</b> below the compliance summary:

After you click <b>Generate report…</b> you will be able to download either a CSV or PDF version of it. These same steps can be repeated for other standards and frameworks report:
