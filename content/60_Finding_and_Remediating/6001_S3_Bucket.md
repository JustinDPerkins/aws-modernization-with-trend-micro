### Scenario

In this scenario we have a use case where a customer accidentally created a bucket and made it public without encryption. Our goal here is to detect the bucket and fix its two main configuration security issues.

<p style='text-align: left;'><b>
It's very important you completed chapter 5 of the workshop before starting this one, because you will need a Trend Micro Cloud One account that is integrated with your AWS account.

We will use the Confomirty dashboard to search for the misconfigurations.

#### 1. Log in to Trend Micro - Cloud One, select Conformity, select the account on your left that you have integrated for this workshop, and then click on "Browse All Checks"

#### 3. Define the Filter check

Here are the configurations that you should apply:

- On <b>Resource Types</b>, search for S3 Bucket and press <b>Enter</b>

If after applying the filter Tag the resource are not showing, it's because you need to force a Run Conformity Bot in the main dashboard as described here <a href="/60_finding_and_remediating.html#force-run-conformity-bot"> Run Conformity Bot </a>

#### 4. How to look for the specific Conformity check to properly perform remediation

Locate the two Conformity checks that pertain to the misconfigurations of this scenario ([S3 Bucket Public Access Via Policy](https://www.cloudconformity.com/knowledge-base/aws/S3/s3-bucket-public-access-via-policy.html#102741628407) and [Server Side Encryption](https://www.cloudconformity.com/knowledge-base/aws/S3/server-side-encryption.html#102741628407)). Next to each, select <b>Resolve</b>, which will populate the step-by-step instructions for remediating these misconfigurations.

#### 5. View more details about the the Conformity checks

Selecting the Conformity checks will allow you to see more details about the misconfiguration that was found. You will also have the direct link to the resource to help you to review and fix the misconfigurations that have been found.

#### 7. Review the remediation  

After completing the remediation for these two use cases, you can return to the Conformity dashboard and click <b>Run Conformity Bot</b> to start a new process. 

The default Conformity process for monitoring is hourly checks performed by the Conformity bot. You can also manually run the checks, or enable the real-time monitoring feature.  

After couple minutes the Conformity Bot check will finish and you can check if the previous configurations will now appear as <b>Succeeded</b> instead of <b>Failed</b>.
