In this modernization workshop, we learned how to bridge the gap between DevOps and Cloud Architect with the Security team using the concept of shifting left security and keeping the visibility in the runtime environment running in AWS. All this is easily mapped with multiple standards and frameworks like AWS Well-Architected Framework, PCI DSS, HIPAA, HISTRUST, and many others. 

Here we tried to show you how important is to have a Cloud Security Posture Manager for your environment and an easy way to make it available for your DevOps and Cloud Architects in your organization. The Communication Workflow in Conformity could help you a lot in this communication workflow with multiple teams inside the different squads.

For any additional help please reach out to Fernando Cardoso - (Email: fernando_cardoso@trendmicro.com)
